Before I go on, thank you for taking time to contribute to this project! If
you have any new ideas or code that you want to add to Antaeus I will be more
than happy to help to implement it or accept your pull request. If you are
unsure on whether your pull request will be helpful, you can always find me
in almost all vex servers in discord. Feel free to chat!
